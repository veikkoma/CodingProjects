# JavaCoding

In this subdirectory I have programming with Java. Nowadays I mainly program in Java, because most of the projects/tasks what I do at school are done in Java. 
You can see the final exercise of the software modelling and design course (JavaModelling) in the directories. In the second directory you can find the exercises of the course Software Quality and Testing, as a rule in the course we used the eclipse programming platform and JUnit testing.
